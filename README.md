# ML-Agents: Penguins

In an effort to experiment with Machine Learning and help my understanding of the MLAgents implementation in Unity for use in future games, I completed the ML-Agents:
Penguins tutorial originally published by Unity but updated by [Immersive Limit LLC](www.immersivelimit.com).

In this repo is the existing code files that programmed the Deep Learning penguins along with their sprites and materials.
